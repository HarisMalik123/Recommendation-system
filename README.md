# Recommendation System Using Graph Theory

## Project Overview

This project explores the use of **graph theory** in building a recommendation system. By modeling user-item interactions as a bipartite graph, we apply graph-based techniques to deliver personalized recommendations effectively.

## Objectives

The primary goals of this project include:

1. **Graph-based Recommendation Modeling:** Represent user-item interactions as a bipartite graph.
2. **Graph Algorithms for Recommendations:** Implement collaborative filtering and random walk-based methods.
3. **Performance Evaluation:** Assess the accuracy and efficiency of the recommendation system.
4. **Library Utilization:** Demonstrate the use of key libraries such as **Surprise, NetworkX, Matplotlib, and Pandas**.
5. **Interactive User Interface:** Develop a menu-driven interface for seamless user interaction.
6. **Personalized Recommendations:** Provide tailored item suggestions based on user preferences.
7. **Price Constraints:** Incorporate filters to recommend items within a specified budget.
8. **Matrix Factorization:** Leverage Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for enhanced recommendation accuracy.

## Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python** (Core programming language)
- **Surprise** (For collaborative filtering & matrix factorization)
- **NetworkX** (For graph-based recommendation modeling)
- **Matplotlib** (For data visualization)
- **Pandas** (For data processing & analysis)
